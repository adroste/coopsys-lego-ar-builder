* good project!
  * shows what is possible !
* complete presentation (in terms of covered aspects)
* not convinced with evaluation plan
  * what are the goals? (think about)
  * -> enable people to work together in a situation where they divide work
  * nice first example questions you can ask
  * => another evaluation method would be an experiment: measure time of building process (with and without tool)
  * measure higher quality with time objectively (& what/how much they did wrong)
